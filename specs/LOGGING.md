# Logging Specification

## Overview

Ozymandias uses the `tracing` crate for comprehensive logging, metrics, and telemetry. This specification defines how logging is implemented throughout the application.

## Logging Levels

- ERROR: Critical errors that prevent normal operation
- WARN: Warning messages for potential issues
- INFO: General operational information
- DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
- TRACE: Very detailed information for deep debugging

## Logging Implementation

### Structured Logging
- All log messages include contextual information
- Use spans to track operation boundaries
- Include relevant metadata with each log entry

### Log Format
```
[timestamp] [level] [target] {metadata} message
```

Example:
```
[2024-03-13T20:00:00Z] [INFO] [ozymandias::commands::init] {command="init"} Initializing new knowledge base
```

### Metrics
- Command execution time
- Operation success/failure rates
- Resource usage statistics

### Telemetry
- Operation tracing across command boundaries
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and reporting

## Configuration

Logging can be configured through:
- Environment variables
- Command-line flags
- Configuration file

Default configuration:
- Level: INFO
- Format: Human-readable
- Output: stderr
