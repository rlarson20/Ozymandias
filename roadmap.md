Here's a draft of the initial documentation for your Rust project:

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a knowledge management solution that enables rapid retrieval, consistent backups, ease of use, and minimization of friction in saving information. The aim is to develop a system that can effectively manage and provide understandable access to a vast amount of existing data and information.

Problems to Solve

    Retrieval: Developing an efficient and effective way to retrieve information from the system.
    Friction: Minimizing the effort required to save and manage information.
    Data formats: Handling various formats of data and information.
    Data representation: Dealing with multiple ways to represent the same information.
    Source of truth: Establishing a single source of truth for information.
    Multiple sources: Managing information from multiple sources.
    Contexts: Handling information in different contexts.
    Public vs private info: Balancing the availability of public and private information.
    Filtering: Filtering out unimportant information and prioritizing important information.

Components

    Storage: Designing a storage system that can efficiently store and manage information.
    Parser: Developing a parser that can handle various formats of data and information.
    Transformer (ETL type): Creating a transformer that can convert and normalize data for efficient storage and retrieval.
    Ontology: Developing an ontology that can provide a framework for organizing and relating information.
    ML components: Integrating machine learning components to enhance the system's capabilities.
    User-facing components: Designing user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the system.

Roadmap

    Phase 1: Research and planning
        Define the scope and requirements of the project
        Research existing knowledge management solutions and identify areas for improvement
        Develop a detailed project plan and timeline
    Phase 2: Storage and parser development
        Design and implement the storage system
        Develop the parser and transformer components
    Phase 3: Ontology and ML component development
        Develop the ontology and integrate it with the storage system
        Integrate machine learning components to enhance the system's capabilities
    Phase 4: User-facing component development
        Design and implement user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the system
    Phase 5: Testing and refinement
        Test the system thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements
        Refine the system based on user feedback and testing results

Notes

    Every object, every item, every relation should have a note
    Build systems from the ground up and iterate fast and smart
    Most things are deeper than they seem but still easier than they appear once you're in them (LessWrong)

This documentation provides a starting point for your project, outlining the problems to solve, components to develop, and a high-level roadmap. It also captures some of the ideas and notes that you've brainstormed, which can be refined and expanded upon as the project progresses.
